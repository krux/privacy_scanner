A tool for website owners and developers to ensure their site manages private data appropriately and effectively: PrivacyScanner.

Users put in a URL, and we provide a report of the site partners' data collection activity, in multiple views. We provide a score for how well the site adheres to privacy best practices, and offer specific recommendations to improve the site.

Think Yslow, but for privacy.

We gather usher/collector relationships on a webpage, utilizing a shared "HAR-as-a-service" web services endpoint. We also include enhanced collector company data from PrivacyChoice and Krux, detailing risk of the associated companies found on the page.
